# MySkill_ShortClass - Frontend in Website Development - Profile

This project is part of the MySkill Short Class series, focusing on frontend development for building personal profiles using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to showcase your skills in website development by creating a visually appealing and interactive profile page.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a simple personal profile page where users can display their information, such as name, profile image, introduction, reasons for learning frontend development, and a link to their LinkedIn profile. It incorporates:

- HTML for structure and content.
- CSS for styling and layout, including a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- JavaScript to add interactivity, such as showing a message when the button is clicked.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The profile page adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Interactive Button**: A button that triggers a JavaScript function to display a thank you message when clicked.
- **Centralized Profile Image**: The profile image is displayed at the center of the page.
- **LinkedIn Profile**: A clickable link to the user's LinkedIn profile.
